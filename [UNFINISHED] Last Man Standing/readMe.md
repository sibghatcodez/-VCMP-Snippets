<h1> Last Man Standing </h1>

<p>[LMS] -> A Vice City MultiPlayer server.</p>


<p>I tried making this server but due to no support from the community and the game being dead I lost motivation and decided to give up</p>
<p>It was just a few days ago that I started working on this but ended up discontinuing the project so now here's all the code i wrote</p>


<h3>I'll list down the things it has.</h3>
