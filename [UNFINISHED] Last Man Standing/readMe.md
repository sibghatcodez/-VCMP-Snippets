<h1> Last Man Standing </h1>

<p>[LMS] -> A Vice City MultiPlayer server.</p>


<p>I tried making this server but due to no support from the community and the game being dead I lost motivation and decided to give up</p>
<p>It was just a few days ago that I started working on this but ended up discontinuing the project so now here's all the code i wrote</p>


<h3>I'll list the down the things it has.</h3>
<ol>
  <li><ul>Account System</ul>
        <li>Survivals</li>
        <li>Kills</li>
        <li>Total Playtime</li>
        <li>Average FPS</li>
        <li>Average Ping</li>
</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ol>
