<h1> Last Man Standing </h1>

<p>[LMS] -> A Vice City MultiPlayer server.</p>


<p>I tried making this server but due to no support from the community and the game being dead I lost motivation and decided to give up</p>
<p>It was just a few days ago that I started working on this but ended up discontinuing the project so now here's all the code i wrote</p>


<h3>I'll list down the things it has.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Account System
    <ul>
      <li>Survivals</li>
      <li>Kills</li>
      <li>Total Playtime</li>
      <li>Average FPS</li>
      <li>Average Ping</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>...</li>

</ol>
