#**Include Function**
- JavaScript has a convenient .includes function, but unfortunately, it's not available in Squirrel. This can be frustrating when you need to repeatedly loop over an array to check for a specific value. That's why I took the initiative to create a simple "include" function specifically for VC:MP.

## The Use
- It has simple syntax, include(arrayName, var)

### Example:
```local fruits = ["mango", "banana", "watermelon"];```
